# macros
A program with a simple interface in PySide6, which allows you to create and use macros.


# how to use:

- pip install -r requirements.txt
- pyinstaller --onefile main.py
- download nsis from https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download
- launch NSIS
- hold and drag nsis_script.nsi to NSIS window
- execute nsis_script.nsi if require
- go to desktop and check file macros.exe
- enjoy ;)

# In any case - you can simply interpret main.py.

# P.S. carefully read all pop-up windows, as well as put stars :)
# P.S.2. the activation key of the program is any numbers.

# Yes, and please don't tell me that the script playback is poorly written - I know. I haven't found another way yet, as otherwise it loads the CPU to 100%.
